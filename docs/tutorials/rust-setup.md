    I have successfuly added admonitions to MkDocs!
    This is just an example of admonitions you will see
    throughout this tutorial for the purpose side content without diturbing document flow :)

``` py
# I have added the code block extention for my partner - Mohammad Saatialsoruji
# Code blocks are an essential part of project documentation
# We will see these many times throughout the tutorial
print("We love COMP 423!")
```
